<HR><H3>Problem 1: Control hijacking</H3>
A proposal for preventing stack buffer overflow attacks is based on
making a backup copy of the return address when a function starts.
The backup copy is written to a shadow stack located at
some <i>random</i> location <i>L</i> on the heap.
In the function epilog, just before the
function is about to return, the backup copy of the return address is
compared to the return address on the stack and if they differ the program
exits.  Otherwise, the return instruction is executed normally.

<p>
(a) Explain why this mechanism can make it harder to mount a stack
buffer overflow attack.

<p>
(b) Give sample C code that is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow
attack even if this mechanism is used.  For example, consider the case
of function pointers stored on the stack.



<!-- ======================================================== -->
<HR><H3>Problem 2:  Return oriented programming</H3>

<p>
Suppose an attacker finds the following code fragments in the libc
library once it is loaded in memory:
</p>
<pre>
0x40002000:
  pop eax       // pop top of stack into register eax
  ret

0x40002700:
  pop ebx       // pop top of stack into register ebx
  ret

0x40002948:
  move [ebx], eax  // write the value of eax to location ebx
  ret
</pre>
<p>
Moreover, the attacker discovers a stack buffer overflow in some
vulnerable application where a string buffer can overflow. Explain
how in an environment where the stack is marked non-execute the
attacker can nevertheless cause the vulnerable application to write
the value 0x30000000 to memory address 0x48000000 and then jump to
address 0x40088888. Your answer need only show the contents of the
stack in the table below right after the buffer overflow takes place.

<HR><H3>Problem 3:  Memory management</H3>

<p>
The iOS &nbsp;  <strong>_MALLOC(size_t size, int type, int flags)</strong> function
allocates <strong>size</strong> bytes on the heap.   Internally blocks are
represented as a length field followed by a data field:
<pre>
    struct _mhead {
      size_t  mlen;
      char    dat[0];  }
</pre>
The <strong>mlen</strong> field is used by the <strong>free()</strong>
function to determine how much space needs to be freed.
In iOS 4.x the <strong>_MALLOC</strong> function was implemented as follows:
<pre>
1   void * _MALLOC(size_t size, int type, int flags)  {
2     struct _mhead  *hdr;
3     size_t memsize = sizeof (*hdr) + size;
4     hdr = (void *)kalloc(memsize);  // allocate memory
5     hdr->mlen = memsize;
6     return  (hdr->dat);
7   }
</pre>
In iOS 5.x the following two lines were added after line 3:
<pre>
    int o = memsize < size ? 1 : 0;
    if (o)  return (NULL);
</pre>

Why were these lines added in iOS5.x?   Briefly describe an attack
that may be possible without these lines.

<HR><h3>Problem 4: Unix access control </h3>

In Unix, every process has a real user id (<i>ruid</i>),
an effective user id (<i>euid</i>), and a saved user id (<i>suid</i>).
Processes with an euid of 0 have special root privileges.

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
If a process with user id <i>n</i> forks to create another process, what user id does the
new process have? (<i>Hint:</i> it's the same answer for euid, ruid, and suid.)



<li class="part">
If a process with euid <i>n</i> makes a setuid system call, what possible
euids can the process run with after the call, in each of the following situations:

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part"> Before: <i>euid = n > 0</i>, saved user id <i>suid=m</i> and
real user id <i>ruid = m</i>.
After:?


<li class="part"> Before: <i>n=0</i>   After:?

</ol>

<li class="part">
In qmail, most modules run under separate user ids. Similarly,
each Android application runs in a separate process using a separate user id.
From a security standpoint, what is the advantage of assigning separate uids
instead of using the same uid for all? Explain.

<!-- 
<li class="part"> Why should the separate uids be <i>non</i>-zero? -->

<li class="part">
The Android zygote process that creates new processes runs as root.
After forking to create a new process, setuid is normally called.
Explain what uid the new process has initially and why it is important to call setuid? What security purpose does this serve?

<li class="part">
When a Unix user wishes to change her password, she uses the passwd program. 
The Unix password file is usually public readable but (for obvious reasons)
can only be written by processes with root privileges. 

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part"> How should the <i>setuid</i> bit be set on this passwd program? 
Explain how this lets a user change her password.
<li class="part"> Why does this make it important to write the passwd program source code carefully?
