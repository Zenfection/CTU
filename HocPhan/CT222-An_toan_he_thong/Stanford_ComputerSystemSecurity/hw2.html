<HR><H3>Problem 1: Same origin policy </H3>

<p>
We discussed in lecture how the DOM same-origin policy defines
an origin as the triple <i>(protocol, domain, port)</i>.
Explain what would go wrong if the DOM same-origin policy
were only defined by the pair <i>(domain, port)</i>.
Give a concrete example of an attack that a network attacker can do
in this case, but cannot do when using the standard definition
of the same-origin policy. 
</p>

<HR><H3>Problem 2: Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) Attacks </H3>

<p>
Consider a banking web site <tt>bank.com</tt> where
after login the user is taken to a user information page 
<pre>
https://bank.com/accountInfo.html
</pre>
The page shows the user's account balances.
Here <tt>accountInfo.html</tt> is a static
page: it contains the page layout, but no user data.
Towards the bottom of the page a script is included as:
<pre>
&lt;script src="//bank.com/userdata.js"&gt; &lt/script&gt      (*)
</pre>
The contents of <tt>userdata.js</tt> is as follows: 
<pre>
displayData({"name": "John Doe",
             "AccountNumber":  12345,
             "Balance": 45})
</pre>
The function <tt>displayData</tt> is defined in
<tt>accountInfo.html</tt> and uses the provided data to populate 
the page with user data.
</p>

<p>
The script <tt>userdata.js</tt> is generated dynamically and is the only
part of the page that contains user data.   Everything else is static
content.    
</p>

<p>
Suppose that after the user logs in to his or her account at <tt>bank.com</tt>
the site stores the user's session token in a browser cookie.
</p>

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
  Consider user <tt>John Doe</tt> who logs into his account at <tt>bank.com</tt>
  and then visits the URL <tt>https://evil.com/</tt>.
  Explain how the page at <tt>evil.com</tt> can cause all of John Doe's data
  to be sent to <tt>evil.com</tt>.   Please provide the
  code contained in the page at <tt>evil.com</tt>.

<li class="part">
  How would you keep <tt>accountInfo.html</tt> as a static page, but
  prevent the attack from part (a)?
  You need only change line (*) and <tt>userdata.js</tt>.
  Make sure to explain why your defense prevents the attack.  <br/>
  <b>Hint:</b>
  Try loading the user's data in a way that gives <tt>bank.com</tt> access
  to the data, but does not give <tt>evil.com</tt> access.  In particular,
  <tt>userdata.js</tt> need not be a Javascript file.

</li>
</ol>


<!-- ======================================================== -->
<HR><H3>Problem 3:  The HTML canvas element  </H3>

<p>
The canvas HTML element creates a 2D rectangular area and lets
Javascript draw whatever it wants in that area.  Canvas is used for
client-side graphics such as drawing a path on a map loaded from
Google maps.  For the purpose of the associated same-origin policy,
the origin of a canvas is the origin of the content that created it.
In the map example, the origin of the Javascript that creates the
canvas is Google.  Canvas lets Javascript read pixels from any canvas
in its origin using the <i>GetImageData()</i> method.
</p>

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
Canvas lets Javascript embed images from any domain
  in the canvas.  Suppose a user has authenticated to a site that
  displays private information. Describe an attack that would be possible if
  Javascript from one domain could embed an image from another domain
  in the canvas and then use <i>GetImageData()</i> to read pixels from that
  image.
</li>

<li class="part">
How would you restrict GetImageData() to prevent the attack above?
</li>

<li class="part">
A canvas element can be placed anywhere in the browser
content area and can be made transparent so that the underlying content
under the canvas shows through.
What security problem arises if calling <i>GetImageData()</i> always returned 
the actual pixels shown on the screen at that position?
</li>

<li class="part">
How would you design <i>GetImageData()</i> to defend against the
vulnerability from part (c)?  Propose a design that does not
require the browser to test if the requested pixel is over content from
another origin.
</li>
</ol>

<hr><h3>Problem 4:  CSRF Defenses </h3>

<ol type="a">
<li class="part">
 In class we discussed Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
 against web sites that rely solely on cookies for session
 management.  Briefly explain a CSRF attack on such a site.

<li class="part">
A common CSRF defense places a token in the DOM of every page
(e.g. as a hidden form element) in addition to the cookie.  An HTTP
request is accepted by the server only if it contains both a valid
HTTP cookie header and a valid token in the POST parameters.  
Why does this prevent the attack from part (a)?

<li class="part">
One approach to choosing a CSRF token is to choose one at random.
Suppose a web site chooses the token as a fresh random string for every HTTP response.
The server checks that this random string is present in the next HTTP request for that session.
Does this prevent CSRF attacks?   If so, explain why.  If not, describe an attack.

<li class="part">
Another approach is to choose the token as a <i>fixed</i> random string chosen by the server.
That is, the same random string is used as the CSRF token in all HTTP responses
from the server over a given time period.  
Does this prevent CSRF attacks?   If so, explain why.  If not, describe an attack.

<li class="part">
Why is the Same-Origin Policy important for the cookie-plus-token defense?

</ol>

<hr><h3>Problem 5:  Inline scripts </h3>

Recall that content security policy (CSP) is an HTTP header sent by a
web site to the browser that tells the browser what it should and
should not do as it is processing the content.

<ol type="a">
<li class="part">
Explain what the following CSP header does:
<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
</pre>
</li>

<li class="part">
What is the purpose of the CSP directive from part (a)? 
What attack is it intended to prevent?
</li>

<li class="part">
What does the following CSP header do:
<pre>
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'
</pre>
What attack does it prevent?
</li>

</ol>


<!-- ======================================================== -->
<hr><h3>Problem 6:   DNSSEC </h3>

DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) is designed to prevent network attacks
such as DNS record spoofing and cache poisoning.
Generally, the DNSSEC server for example.com will posses the
IP address of www.example.com.
When queried about this record that it possesses, the DNSSEC server 
will return its answer with an associated signature.
If the DNSEC server is queried about a host that does not
exist, such as doesnotexist.example.com,
the server uses NSEC or NSEC3 to show
that the DNS server does <i>not</i> have an answer to the query.

<p>
Suppose a user R (a <i>resolver,</i> in DNS terminology) queries a DNSSEC <i>server</i> S,
but all of the network traffic between R and S is visible to a <i>network attacker</i> N.
The attacker N may read requests from R to S and may send packets to R that appear to originate from S.

</p>
<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">Why is authenticated denial of existence necessary?
To answer this question, assume that S sends the same unsigned DOES-NOT-EXIST
response to any query for which it has no matching record.
Describe a possible attack.
</li>

<li class="part">Assume now that S cryptographically signs its DOES-NOT-EXIST response, but
the response does not say what query it is a response to.
How is an attack still possible?
</li>

<li class="part">
A DNSSEC server may send a signed NSEC response to a query
that does not have a matching record (such as doesnotexist.example.com).
An NSEC response contains two names, corresponding to
the existent record on the server that immediately precedes the query (in lexicographic order),
and the existent record that immediately follows the query.
For example, if a DNSSEC server has records for a.example.com, b.example.com, and c.example.com,
the NSEC response to a query for (non-existent) abc.example.com contains a.example.com and b.example.com
because these come just before and just after the requested name.
To be complete, NSEC records also wrap-around,
so a query for a non-existent name after the last existent name
will receive an NSEC containing the last and first existent names.
<p>
How should the resolver use the information contained in NSEC records to prevent the attacks
you described in previous parts of this problem?
</p></li>

<li class="part">
NSEC leaks information that may be useful to attackers on the Internet.
Describe how an attacker can use NSEC to enumerate all of the hosts sharing
a common domain-name suffix.
How is this information useful for attackers?
</li>

<li class="part">NSEC3 is designed to prevent DNS responses from revealing unnecessary information.
NSEC3 uses the lexicographic order of hashed records, instead of their unhashed order.
In response to a query without a matching record,
NSEC3 will return the hashed names that are just before and just after the hash of the query.
For example, on a server containing a.example.com, b.example.com, and c.example.com,
if a hashes to 30, b to 10, c to 20, and abc to 15, the
NSEC3 response to a query for abc.example.com would contain 10.example.com and 20.example.com.
Hashed names are also assumed to wrap around, in the same way as unhashed names in NSEC.
<p>Explain how a resolver should verify the validity of a response under NSEC3?
